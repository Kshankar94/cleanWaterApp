Provide access to clean water is one of the NAE 14 grand challenges for engineering. Lack of clean water is responsible for more deaths in the world than the war. Today, it is being a critical problem about the availability of water for drinking in many areas of the world.

“World’s water supplies are facing new threats; affordable, advanced technologies could make a difference for millions of people around the world”

And so are the engineers in different fields working collaboratively to provide sophisticated methods to meet the water availability and the water quality the society needs. However, there arises the questions of where the clean water is available in plenty or what are the areas the engineers need to adopt their technologies for purification.

Technologies used:

  Front end – HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Flexbox, ReactJS
  
  API - Google location/places.

  Database – Firebase
